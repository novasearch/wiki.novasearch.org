* If an IO operation (e.g.: listing directory contents) hangs your Kerberos ticket might have expired. Please use another terminal and reconnect to the node you need to renew the ticket. The IO operation will be executed then.

* To copy data to another machine you can simply put it on your home directory and copy it from there. However, if you're copying a dataset to a computing node's /localstore directory consider using SCP.
