== Overview ==

'''NovaSearchServices''' is a set of APIs that allows the creation of applications that feature extraction for images and text, indexing and retrieval.

Build on top of the best available image processing, classification and retrieval libraries,
It was designed for speed (programmed in C++) and easy of use for rapid prototyping using state-of-the-art image processing, indexing and machine learning algorithms

The repo for the framework is available [https://bitbucket.org/a_mourao/searchservices here] (request access to André Mourão).

== Details for the framework components: ==

=== Core ===

==== Analyser ====

Using a factory paradigm and common interfaces, the framework enables simple interchanging of components. 
These features make testing multiple combinations of techniques painless and allow rapid prototyping and the creation of perfect solutions for a wide range of CBMI and classification tasks and challenges.

''' Available algorithms '''

Feature extractors:
* Global image features (nVector/FeatureExtractor.h)
** Gabor
** GIST
** LBP
** HSV histograms
** CEDD
** FCTH
** Eigen extractor (PCA)
* Keypoint based (nKeypoint/KeypointFeatureExtractor.h)
** SURF
** SIFT
** ORB

Object detectors (nRoi/RoiFeatureExtractor.h):
* Face detection
* Person detection
* Generic Haar-based object detector

Classifiers (nTag/IClassifier.h):
* Sparse approximation
* SVM
* Vowpal Wabbit
* kNN

==== Indexing ====

The indexers follow the same interchangeability model. Available implementations allow balancing speed and accuracy to answer any task requirements.

Indexers:
* Sparse approximation
* MSIDX
* E2LSH
* Spherical Hashing
* Linear
* kd and kMeans tree

==== Endpoints ====

NSS runs as a service that communicates using REST endpoints 
Developers can hand-craft solution to the retrieval or classification tasks, or use our generic classifier or indexer that leverage on the interchangeability properties of the framework.

=== Extra ===

==== Multimodal retrieval support ====

The framework supports retrieval from independent indexes that communicate through REST and output JSON in a simple standard format. The results are combined using a Federator, a Django-based application that makes the requests to the indexes, combines and outputs the final rank. It is available [https://bitbucket.org/a_mourao/federator here] (request access to André Mourão).

==== External feature extractors ====

The framework supports feature extractors from "outside" programs through REST and output JSON in a simple standard format.

== Setup ==

=== Dependencies: ===

* HDF5 
* Flann 
 
* OpenCV 2.4.9
* FFTW 3
* Armadillo 
* lapack 
* blas 

* Poco
* libcurl 
* pugixml
* jsoncpp

==== Getting the dependencies: ====

64 bit versions of these libraries are '''available at Ariadne''' under <code>/localstore/searchservices/</code>.

The easiest way to '''run framework in local computer''' is to:
* get code from [https://bitbucket.org/a_mourao/searchservices git]
* copy libraries to the same folder on local computer
* build using the provided Makefile

'''Tested on Ubuntu 13.10/14.04'''

'''Atention:''' there are additional dependencies (e.g. libav), available on the default Ubuntu PPA. On '''14.10''', the required '''libav''' version is '''not available''' on the repo and needs to be installed/downloaded '''manually'''.

=== Building: ===

The project is being developed using [http://www.codeblocks.org/ Codeblocks].
For convenience, developers can also generate a Makefile with all possible targets using [http://sourceforge.net/projects/cbp2make/ cbp2make] (also available on the Ubuntu Repo)

<code>cbp2make -in searchservices.cbp -out Makefile</code>

Before compiling and running, you may need to add the following libraries folders to the env. vars. Simple example:

<code> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/localstore/searchservices/libs/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH && export LIBRARY_PATH=/localstore/searchservices/libs/bin:$LIBRARY_PATH && export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/localstore/searchservices/libs/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH && export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/localstore/searchservices/libs/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH && export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH && export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/lib/amd64/server/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH </code>

==== Build with Makefile: ====

Simply run <code>make</code> on the project root folder
Binaries will be deployed in <code>bin/Release</code> and <code>bin/Debug</code>

=== Running: ===

There are 2 main ways to execute code on the framework:

==== Server: ====

The server runs a REST service that receives requests on a set of configurable endpoints.

<code>./bin/Release/server <config.json> </code>

The JSON file sets what endpoints to run and their parameters.

==== Other: ====

In addition to the server, there are two targets for batch execution and testing. The main methods are the following:

* <code>./bin/Release/runAnalyser</code>: analyser/Main2.cpp
* <code>./bin/Release/runindexer</code>: analyser/Main3.cpp
