== Overview ==

'''NovaSearchServices''' is a set of APIs that allows the creation of applications that feature extraction for images and text, indexing and retrieval.

Build on top of the best available image processing, classification and retrieval libraries,
It was designed for speed (programmed in C++) and easy of use for rapid prototyping using state-of-the-art image processing, indexing and machine learning algorithms

The repo for the framework is available [https://bitbucket.org/a_mourao/searchservices here] (request access to André Mourão).

== Details for the framework components: ==

=== Core ===

==== Analyser ====

Using a factory paradigm and common interfaces, the framework enables simple interchanging of components. 
These features make testing multiple combinations of techniques painless and allow rapid prototyping and the creation of perfect solutions for a wide range of CBMI and classification tasks and challenges.

''' Available algorithms '''

Feature extractors:
* Global image features (nVector/FeatureExtractor.h)
** Gabor
** GIST
** LBP
** HSV histograms
** CEDD
** FCTH
** Eigen extractor (PCA)
* Keypoint based (nKeypoint/KeypointFeatureExtractor.h)
** SURF
** SIFT
** ORB

Object detectors (nRoi/RoiFeatureExtractor.h):
* Face detection
* Person detection
* Generic Haar-based object detector

Classifiers (nTag/IClassifier.h):
* Sparse approximation
* SVM
* Vowpal Wabbit
* kNN

==== Indexing ====

The indexers follow the same interchangeability model. Available implementations allow balancing speed and accuracy to answer any task requirements.

Indexers:
* Sparse approximation
* MSIDX
* E2LSH
* Spherical Hashing
* Linear
* kd and kMeans tree

==== Endpoints ====

NSS runs as a service that communicates using REST endpoints 
Developers can hand-craft solution to the retrieval or classification tasks, or use our generic classifier or indexer that leverage on the interchangeability properties of the framework.

=== Extra ===

==== Multimodal retrieval support ====

The framework supports retrieval from independent indexes that communicate through REST and output JSON in a simple standard format. The results are combined using a Federator, a Django-based application that makes the requests to the indexes, combines and outputs the final rank. It is available [https://bitbucket.org/a_mourao/federator here] (request access to André Mourão).

==== External feature extractors ====

The framework supports feature extractors from "outside" programs through REST and output JSON in a simple standard format.
