ThinkPad is one of the first options for many geeks, students and Linux users. It is the standard option available in Lenovo's X Series under 12-13 inches display category.

=== Hardware ===
Below is the short list for this setup. ''After-market SSDs were bought'' because Lenovo is charging a lot for these.

==== Compatibility ====

Everything works out-of-the-box except the integrated fingerprint scanner. To enable it you need to install some extra packages: {{ic|apt-get install libpam-fprintd}}

Just make sure you press ESC and login with your password when you boot the computer if you want your login keyring to be unlocked.

=== System Configuration ===

==== Kernel ====

The following enables the new P-state Intel CPU scheduler and some power saving options.

{{hc|/etc/default/grub|2=<nowiki>
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash intel_pstate=enable pcie_aspm=force drm.vblankoffdelay=1"
</nowiki>
}}

The following forces some power saving options for the Intel graphics cards.

{{hc|/etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf|2=<nowiki>
options i915 i915_enable_rc6=7 i915_enable_fbc=1 lvds_downclock=1 semaphores=1
</nowiki>
}}

==== TrackPoint ====

You can change the default speed and sensitivity of the TrackPoint.

{{hc|/etc/udev/rules.d/10-trackpoint.rules|2=<nowiki>
SUBSYSTEM=="serio", DRIVERS=="psmouse", WAIT_FOR="/sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/sensitivity", ATTR{sensitivity}="220", ATTR{speed}="110"
</nowiki>
}}

==== PulseAudio ====

Automatically switch to Bluetooth or USB headset by adding the following:

{{hc|/etc/pulse/default.pa|2=<nowiki>
# automatically switch to newly-connected devices
load-module module-switch-on-connect</nowiki>
}}

==== SSD ====

If you are using an SSD enable TRIM to always get the best performance. Just add {{ic|discard}} to the mount options. The {{ic|relatime}} option avoids some writes on the SSD which is also desirable.

{{hc|/etc/fstab|2=<nowiki>
/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root / ext4 errors=remount-ro,relatime,discard 0 1
</nowiki>
}}

If you use LVM you have to also change a line in the LVM configuration file.

{{hc|/etc/lvm/lvm.conf|2=<nowiki>
issue_discards = 1
</nowiki>
}}

==== Intel Rapid Start Technology ====

The Intel chipset supports Intel Rapid Start, a technology that allows the laptop to go into a deeper sleep ACPI S4 (hibernate) from ACPI S3 (standby) after some period of time.

This type of hibernation is directly supported in the hardware, so you will not see any traditional OS boot sequences during wake up from a hibernated machine as before.

To setup Intel Rapid Start you need:

 * an SSD
 * a BIOS that supports Intel Rapid Start Technology
 * a partition (primary/logical) >= than the laptop's physical memory

Then you must give the partition a specific id as to be recognized by the hardware. According to Intel, it must be:

 * in fdisk, id: 84, or
 * in gdisk, guid: D3BFE2DE-3DAF-11DF-BA40-E3A556D89593

==== Bluetooth ====

Problem: A number of Bluetooth profiles won't work until the firmware is loaded.

Download this [[File:Fw-0a5c 21e6.hcd]] and put it at {{ic|/lib/firmware/fw-0a5c_21e6.hcd}} (all lowercase)

==== Zram/Compcache ====

If you are low on memory you can always compress your data in RAM.

Just issue {{ic|apt-get install zram-config}} and check if it works with {{ic|cat /proc/swaps}}
