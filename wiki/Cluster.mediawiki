We are very fortunate to have a powerful computing cluster to aid in research and development. Currently this cluster is composed by 4 identical rack-mounted (4u) computing nodes with GPGPU capability and an additional tower computer that serves as the master node. The latter is used for issuing jobs or tasks, to be processed in the cluster, and for management, coordination and distribution of said jobs or tasks. It is also used occasionally to host internet-facing demos of our work.

== Machines ==

Our machines are named after characters in Science-Fiction works. Flavio Martins unilaterally decided to start with the characters from the Christopher Nolan movie "Inception".
