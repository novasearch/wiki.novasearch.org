X2Go Remote access
------------------

This a remote desktop solution akin to FreeNX. It is really fast and
useful for working directly on the cluster machines when you don't have
access to a Linux machine of your own. You can reconnect and get your
desktop session back (e.g.: windows and apps from last session).

Please take in mind that a desktop session takes up significant
resources so use this feature wisely and log out your session when you
don't need it anymore.

Terminal sessions
-----------------

You can use the screen and tmux terminal multiplexing software to
persist your console sessions on the nodes.
